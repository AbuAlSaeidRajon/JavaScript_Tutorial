A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes. -->

<!-- Escape Character
Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".

The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Code	Result	Description
\'	      '	    Single quote
\"	       "	Double quote
\\	       \	Backslash
The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string: -->

let  = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

<!-- Breaking Long Code Lines
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>
The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
</script>

<!-- You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash: -->

<p>
You can break a code line within a text string with a backslash.

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \

</script>
<!-- The \ method is not the preferred method. It might not have universal support.
Some browsers do not allow spaces behind the \ character. -->

<!-- A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition: -->

<p>The safest way to break a code line in a string is using string addition.</p>

<!-- JavaScript Strings as Objects: 

Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
let x = "John";

But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
let y = new String("John");
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>JavaScript Strings</h1>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// x is a string
let x = "John";

// y is an object
let y = new String("John");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
typeof x + "<br>" + typeof y;
</script>

<!-- Do not create Strings objects.
The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
String objects can produce unexpected results: -->

<!-- When using the == operator, x and y are equal: -->
<h2>Never Create Strings as Objects</h2>
<p>Strings and objects cannot be safely compared.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// x is a string
// y is an object
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = (x==y);
</script>

<!-- Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).
(x == y) true or false? -->
