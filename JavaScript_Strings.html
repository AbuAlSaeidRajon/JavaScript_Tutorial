<!-- Escape Character
Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".

The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Code	Result	Description
\'	      '	    Single quote
\"	       "	Double quote
\\	       \	Backslash
The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string: -->
