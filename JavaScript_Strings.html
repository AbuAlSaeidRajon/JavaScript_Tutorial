<!-- Escape Character
Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".

The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Code	Result	Description
\'	      '	    Single quote
\"	       "	Double quote
\\	       \	Backslash
The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>

<p>The escape sequence \" inserts a double quote in a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let  = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;

<!-- Breaking Long Code Lines
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: -->

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>
The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
</script>

<!-- You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash: -->

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

<!-- The \ method is not the preferred method. It might not have universal support.
Some browsers do not allow spaces behind the \ character. -->

<!-- A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition: -->
